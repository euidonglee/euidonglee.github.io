## Creating Unity GameObject
We create a Player object by adding **GameObject > 2D Object > Sprite.**
Then we create **Head, Body, and Foot** child objects under Player.

For each body parts, we add a **Box Collider** and set its area.

Finally we add a **PlayerController**, **Box Collider**, **Rigidbody**, and **Animator** to our parent Player object.
